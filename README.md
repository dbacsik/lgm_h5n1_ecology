# lgm_h5n1_ecology
Analysis of H5N1 genomes generated from wildlife samples collected in Peru.

This notebook contains code and documentation for the anlaysis of H5N1 influenza virus genomes sampled from wildlife collected in Peru.

This repository is based on and uses some code from the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).

## Best Practices
### Commits and pull requests are required
**Please do not edit the codebase directly.**  
All changes should be documented in commits. Small commits are strongly preferred over large ones. Commits should have brief descriptive commit messages (1 sentence or less).   
**Pull requests are required.** These should have longer descriptions, and should include both the goal of the PR and any critical technical details. Peer review is not required and you may merge your own pull requests.

### Style guide
Please try to conform to the following style guide, with some important additions/exceptions: [https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2017/fall/12100-1/style-guide/index.html](https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2017/fall/12100-1/style-guide/index.html)

- Variable names should be brief and descriptive. Whole words are preferred to abbreviations.
- By default, variable names should not include their datatype. Specifically, df need not be used.
- Data is organized in [long-form Tidy format ](https://kiwidamien.github.io/what-is-tidy-data.html) for storage and manipulation whenever possible.
- One or few CSV files are input and output from each notebook or script. The data in these is selected carefully.
